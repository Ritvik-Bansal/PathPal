PathPal is a nonprofit mobile app built to help elderly travelers, especially those in immigrant communities, navigate airports safely by matching them with verified volunteer companions. The platform allows families to ensure that their loved ones travel with support, dignity, and clear communication from departure to arrival.

## Overview

PathPal was inspired by my own family’s challenges finding someone trustworthy to help my grandfather travel internationally. Many seniors struggle with mobility, language barriers, and airport navigation, while their children often cannot accompany them due to work or distance. PathPal bridges this gap by connecting travelers with vetted volunteers who can assist throughout the journey.
